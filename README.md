# Python-Programming: First Programs, Data Structures
This repository contains the programs I worked on while learning to code in Python 3.
This class covered two books, "First Programs" and "Data Structures". In these two books we covered the following topics:
## First Programs:
* Software develpment, data types, and expressions
* Control statements
* Strings and text files
* Lists and dictionaries
* Design with functions
* Simple graphics and image processing
* Design with classes
* Graphical user interfaces
* Multithreading, networks, and client/server programming

## Data Structures:
* Searching, sorting, and complexity analysis
* Arrays and linked structures
* Interfaces, implementations, and polymorphism
* Inheritance and abstract classes
* Stacks
* Queues
* Lists
* Trees
* Sets and dictionaries
* Graphs
